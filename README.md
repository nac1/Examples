# Examples
A complete set of examples for the eight types of norms is provided for each of the two approaches.

- For the Controlled **Natural Language (CNL)** approach, we use Attempto Controlled English (ACE).
- For the **Large Language Model (LLM)** approach, we use ChatGPT.

Both techniques accept **prompts** in TXT format as input and generate **ontologies in OWL 2** as output.
