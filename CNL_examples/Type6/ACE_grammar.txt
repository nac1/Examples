Step1.
ACE grammar:
Every circle is a geometry_class .
Every practicable_space is a space
    that has at least 1 circle .

Comment:The circle class contains valid instances associated with practicable spaces.
The circles should be updated to support the external process.

Step2.
ACE grammar:
Every circle is a geometry_class .
Every practicable_space is a space
    that has at least 1 circle
    and
    whose free_impact_rotation_door number is 1 .
    and
    whose interior_route number is 1 .

ACE message: Text could not be translated.

Our idea:
Interior_route data property works as boolean datat type. ACE does not support boolean. 
interior_route should be update for external process that verify the internal route (a specif distance).
